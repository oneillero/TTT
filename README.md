# Tic Tac Toe Game
This project provides an interactive and user-friendly Tic Tac Toe game. It's a modern take on a classic game, using the latest React hooks and context API. The game is designed with an appealing and intuitive user interface, providing a great user experience. It's a perfect example of a small, but non-trivial, application that demonstrates the power of React.

# Features
Player Turns: The game keeps track of each player's turns, alternating between the two players. This ensures a fair game by enforcing the rules of Tic Tac Toe.

Move Validations: The game validates each move by ensuring that a cell hasn't been previously clicked. This preserves the integrity of the game and prevents any confusion or mistakes.

Customized Stylizations: The game features a unique and engaging design, implemented using CSS. One of the standout features is the dynamic background color change of cells upon being clicked, providing a visual indicator of a successful move. The cells automatically reset to their original color when a new game begins or the current game is reset.

Modular Design: The game follows a modular design structure, which makes the code easy to understand and maintain.

# Roadmap
The future plan for this project includes the following:

Implement a score tracker to keep a running tally of the number of games won by each player.
Add an AI opponent for single-player mode, making the game enjoyable even when you're alone.
Implement different difficulty levels for the AI opponent.
Enhance the user interface with animations and sound effects to enrich the gameplay experience.
